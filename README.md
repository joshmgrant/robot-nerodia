# robot-nerodia
A very basic example of using Nerodia with Robot Framework

## Setup and Installation

To install, use the following:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*NOTE*: This code has only been verified with Python 3.6. If you need another version, please open an issue here!
*OTHER NOTE*: This framework currently uses [Sauce Labs](https://saucelabs.com/) but can be modified to use local Selenium browsers as well.

## Tests

This is a testing framework example, so to run tests do the following:

```
robot *.robot
```
